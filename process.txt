	- Manages game logic
	- Registers users
	- Manages chat log

Possible Players:
	- Narrator
	- Cop
	- Doctor
	- Mafia
	- Townsman

Game Flow:
	- Controller starts and listens for connections
	- When a a connection is established, all the information about that connection is stored.
	- Register 5 players minimum
	- Five players are registered, and no one else connects within 5 seconds, continue to set up the game
	- Each player is randomly assigned a role.
		- Only one Narrator, Cop, Doctor, and Mafia. Rest are townspeople
	- Result of assignment is communicated to each player

	- Now go into game flow loop
		- Show list of players currently alive
		- Ask the mafia who from the list they want to kill
		- Ask the cop who from the list they want to investigate (the cop will get a yes/no answer as to whether the person is mafia or not)
		- Ask the Doctor who from the list they want to save
			- Doctor's power trumps the Mafia's power
		- Then show a special prompt shows up to the Narrator to enter a story for the killed person. If a person was saved, then this should also be shown to the Narrator.
		- Somebody dies
		
		- Show "Open for chat" message
		- Show client a prompt and accept all messages from all clients
		- Write all received comments to a log and broadcast to all other clients along with who said that comment
		- Once someone has been decided to be killed off, then appointed spokesperson (by the central server) will type "KILL".
		- A special prompt will show up asking for the name of the person that is to be killed.
		- The selected person dies
		- Then we loop. This continues until only the mafia is left, or the mafia is killed

	
	- At the end of the game, all the assignments are revealed.

Notes:
	- Dead players can still see the chat log, but cannot participate
